Analyze the following resume content and extract information into the defined categories. Provide the output in JSON format without any additional text or explanations. Each piece of text in the resume must be assigned to the appropriate section. If the text does not clearly belong to a specific section, place it under "Undefined" and suggest the closest possible section. Pay attention to any typos and alternative spellings and attempt to correct them based on context.

Instructions:

- Use only the categories specified in the JSON format below. Do not create new categories or keys.
- Ensure that all text in the resume is included in one of the sections.
- Handle common typos and spelling mistakes by matching similar words or phrases to the most appropriate section (e.g., "skilz" to "skills").
- Do **not** use ellipses ("...") or any placeholders to indicate missing or incomplete information. If any section is incomplete or unknown, return an empty string or an empty list.
- Always format the response as a valid JSON object, using empty strings or empty lists where data is missing.
- All dates must be formatted as "MMM YYYY" (e.g., "Jan 2020"). If a precise date is not available, use an empty string.
- If a section or category is not clear, classify it as "Undefined" and suggest the most likely section.
- For the "experience" section, include all job positions mentioned in the resume, even if some details are missing.
- In the "skills" section, list all technical skills, tools, and technologies mentioned throughout the resume.
- For "education", include all degrees and certifications mentioned, even if some details are missing.
- If social media profiles or links are mentioned (e.g., LinkedIn), include them in the "social_media" section.
- Any additional information that doesn't fit into the predefined categories should be placed in the "undefined" section with an appropriate section name suggestion.
